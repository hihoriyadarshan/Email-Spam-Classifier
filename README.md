# Email Spam Classifier Project

## Introduction

- **Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham).

- **Dataset**: Utilize the email dataset from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhaskarreddy072/mail-datacsv).

- **Techniques**: Apply natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.

- **Process**:
  - Data exploration and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model building and evaluation
  - Model deployment
    
- **Goal**: Enhance email filtering by accurately identifying spam, ensuring only legitimate emails reach the inbox.

- **Outcome**: A robust spam detection system ready for practical use and further development.
